Hooks for IKEA Omar Shelf
===

Url: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3199472

A customizable hook that perfectly fits the rods on the IKEA Omar shelf. We use it to hang our kitchen utensils.
The hook has a tight fit so that it doesn't fall off or move too much when hanging or taking items.

*Update: Added a "double hook" hook which holds on to two rods on the side of the shelves and therefore sits much more tightly.*
