My OpenSCAD Parts 
---

I'm storing parts that I design in this repository.

External libraries must be checked out into the *external* directory and are referenced by some of the designs.
After checking out the repository, you should fetch them using:
``` 
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

My own libraries live in the *libs* folder.
